                              <h4>FLUTTERCLUB GENERAL BONUS TERMS AND CONDITIONS:</h4>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>1. All bonuses are limited to one per person, per household/IP, unless otherwise specified.</li>
                                  <li>2. Players from the following countries are not permitted to receive the first deposit bonus and or any deposit bonuses unless otherwise stated: Poland, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Croatia, Ukraine, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Philippines, Russia, Czech Republic, Portugal, Slovakia and Latvia.</li>
                                  <li>3. To claim the welcome bonus or any deposit bonus, the user must make a minimum deposit of 0.05 BTC / 1,500 XRP / 2.25 RADR. For example, the player will automatically receive their first bonus after depositing an initial 0.05 BTC / 1,500 XRP / 2.25 RADR. The second deposit bonus will be triggered once the player makes a second deposit of 0.05 BTC / 1,500 XRP / 2.25 RADR or more at FlutterClub. The same rule applies for the third deposit bonus.</li>
                                  <li>4. Once the first step of the welcome package is activated, the customer can then switch currency as follows, i.e. if a player deposits 0.05 BTC and activates the first step of welcome package, he can then claim the second step by depositing in XRP or RADR, and so on for the third deposit.</li>
                                  <li>5. All bonuses (unless otherwise specified) need to be wagered 35 (thirty five) times before the funds can be withdrawn.</li>
                                  <li>6. Different games contribute to a different percentage towards the wagering requirements. Slots contribute 100%, while all table games, casual games and video poker contribute 5%. Sportsbook wagering does not contribute.</li>
                                  <li>7. Players can request a withdrawal of their deposited amount prior to meeting the wagering requirements. However, the bonus amount and winnings will be forfeited as a result. Please note that when playing with a bonus, real money gets exhausted first.</li>
                                  <li>8. All deposit and free cash bonuses will expire after 30 days.</li>
                                  <li>9. Bonus funds and winnings will be forfeited upon expiry of the bonus.</li>                                  </li>
                                  <li>10. When betting, placed bets are deducted from the player’s cash balance. However, if no cash balance is available the bet placed will be deducted from the player’s bonus balance.</li>
                                  <li>11. Until the play through requirements have been met, the maximum bet that can be placed is 15 mBTC (0.015 BTC) / 450 XRP / 23.60 RADR. This includes double up wagers after the game round has been completed, for example, wagering winnings from X game round on red/black.</li>
                                  <li>12. Any bonus can be removed prior to any wagering conditions being met. Please contact FlutterClub support to learn more and request removal.</li>
                                  <li>13. Only one bonus can be claimed at a time. Deposit related bonuses cannot be "stacked". FlutterClub management reserve the right to void any bonuses and/or winnings obtained by fraudulent behaviour.</li>
                                  <li>14. Any ‘’free spin’’ or ‘’bonus’’ winnings resulting from bonus funds after the bonus has been wagered, lost or forfeited shall be removed.</li>
                                  <li>15. FlutterClub management have the right to update these rules at any time.</li>

                              </ul>
                              <h4>8% BitBack on FlutterClub Sportsbook</h4>
                              <p>We recognise that not every bet is always a winning one. Thats why we are launching our biggest Cashback giveaway offering all FlutterClub Sportsbook customers 8% back on any sporting losses until the end of August 2015.

                                  Once registered you will automatically receive 8% BitBack on your monthly aggregate losses paid directly into your FlutterClub account.</p>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>1. To qualify for this BitBack offer you must be aged 18 years or over and be a customer of FlutterClub.com  placing bets between 00:00:00 on 01/04/15 and 11:59:59 on 31/08/15 and have registered for this offer by completing the offer registration form accessed from the Home Page. Playing for fun does not contribute to eligibility for this offer. This offer is only open to residents of those countries or states where FlutterClub accepts customers and is subject to FlutterClub’s normal full rules, terms and conditions.</li>
                                  <li>2. Participating customers will automatically have their FlutterClub account credited with 8% of their *net calendar monthly losses as returns.</li>
                                  <li>3. Only one BitBack registration per person. Customers with multiple accounts will not be eligible for more than one Cash Back. New accounts being opened to claim additional BitBack back will be closed and BitBack funds not credited. In the event of any offer abuse being identified or suspected, promotional bonuses will not be granted and management reserves the right to prohibit or exclude certain individuals, groups or regions from promotions with immediate effect.</li>
                                  <li>4. Customers whose account becomes closed prior to the date of BitBack credit (on or before the fifth day of each month) will not qualify for the offer.</li>
                                  <li>5. Withdrawals of BitBack credit must comply with existing FlutterClub withdrawal rules located in the FAQs tab</li>
                                  <li>6. Cash Back Offer will run until 31/08/15.</li>
                                  <li>7. This is a cash back promotion. Any pending bonuses related to other bonus schemes remain unaffected and do not affect this promotion.</li>
                                  <li>8. FlutterClub may cancel, terminate, modify or suspend the promotion or these terms and conditions at any point and for any reason, including for technical reasons such as and not limited to computer viruses, bugs, tampering or technical failures.</li>
                                  <li>9. In the event of a betting dispute, FlutterClub reserve the right to withhold BitBack credit payments until resolution of dispute.</li>
                                  <li>10. Void bets, other losing bonuses and losing free bets will not be included in BitBack calculations.</li>
                                  <li>11. Details of any BitBack credit will be included in the customer statement. Customers who have opted to receive marketing information will also be sent an email.</li>

                              <small>* net monthly losses on settled sportsbook bets (excluding all casino games) between the first and last days of each calendar month except for the first month when net monthly losses will be calculated from date of registration for the offer and the last day of that month.

                    automatically receive a 100% bonus up to 0.35 BTC / 10,500 XRP / 15.75 RADR. That

                    means if you decide to deposit 0.35 BTC / 10,500 XRP / 15.75 RADR then you’ll have 0.7

                    BTC / 21,000XRP / 31.50 RADR to play with!</li>
                 <li>2. We don’t stop there at FlutterClub - make a second deposit of 0.05 BTC / 1,500 XRP /

                      (deposit 1.6 BTC / 48,000 XRP / 72 RADR to make the most of this) to help make your

                      money go further.</li>
                  <li>3. To top it off, when you make a third deposit of 0.05 BTC / 1,500 XRP / 2.25 RADR or
